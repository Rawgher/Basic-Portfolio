            <p>Hi, I'm Roger. I graduated from UC Davis in 2014 with a bachelor's degree in Animal 
                Biology. I had always wanted to work with animals, until I discovered coding.</p>
            <p>I am really into building things, and I think that coding will give me a fun
                way to do that. Please check out my portfolio <!--link porfolio here--> if 
                you have some time.</p>
